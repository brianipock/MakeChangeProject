###Make Change Project
The cash register in this program will be the operating system that is
requesting inputs from the user (cashier).

In the first iteration the cash register will prompt the user(cashier) to enter the cost of the item purchased by the customer.

The user (cashier) is then asked to enter into the cash register how much money the customer gave for the purchase of the item. This can be given as either an integer or an amount with change (decimal points).

The program will prompt and error message if the customer gave the user(cashier) an insufficient amount of money to purchase the item.
The program will also prompt a message if the customer game the user(cashier) the exact change, thus completing the transaction.

If the customer gave the cashier more money than the cost of the item, the cash register will prompt the user(cashier) to return money to the customer in a sequential order starting with the largest money units, until the proper amount of change is received.
